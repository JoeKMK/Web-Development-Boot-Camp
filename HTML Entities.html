    <title>HTML Entities</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>In this article, we will know HTML Entities, along with understanding their implementation through the examples. HTML provides some method to display reserved characters. Reserved characters are those characters that are either reserved for HTML or those which are not present in the basic keyboard. For instance, ‘<‘ is reserved in HTML language. Sometimes this character needs to display on the web page which creates ambiguity in code. Along with these are the characters which are normally not present in basic keyboard ( £, ¥, €, © ), etc. HTML provides some Entity names and Entity numbers to use these symbols. Entity names are case-sensitive. Entity number is easy to learn. </p>
    <pre>Some useful Symbols with their Entity name and Entity numbers are listed below:
