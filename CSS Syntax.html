        <p>Use the !important property to override other styles</p>
        <pre>
            What is !important?
    
    The !important rule in CSS is used to add more importance to a property/value than normal.
    
    In fact, if you use the !important rule, it will override ALL previous styling rules for that specific property on that element!
    Tip: It is good to know about the !important rule. You might see it in some CSS source code. However, do not use it unless you absolutely have to.
    Let us look at an example:
         </pre>


        <!--
            #myid {
  background-color: blue;
}

.myclass {
  background-color: gray;
}

p {
  background-color: red !important;
}
-->

        <!-- 
        use "classes" to style a group of related items and "id" to style a single item.
        IDs can only be used once on a page, classes can be used multiple times.
        classes are preceded by a dot (.) and IDs are preceded by a hash (#).
        Pseudo-classes are used to define a special state of an element.
    -->
