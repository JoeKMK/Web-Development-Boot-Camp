        <p>Each HTML element is displayed as a box. div doesn't do anything unless you use css with it.
            The div element is often used as a container for other HTML elements to style them with CSS or to
            perform certain tasks with JavaScript.
        </p>

        <p> The div element is also a block-level element, which means it will always start on a new line and take up
            the whole width (100%) available.
            The div element is a container for other HTML elements. It has no effect on the content or layout until
            you apply CSS to it.
        </p>
        <p>
            User agent stylesheet is the default style sheet used by browsers.
            Every single HTML element on screen is treated as a box by our css.
            viewport is the screen that you're viewing the website on.
        </p>

        <p>Common block elements are div, h1, p, form, header, footer, section, article, nav, etc.
            Common inline elements are span, a, img, input, label, etc.

        <p>
            The box model is the way that CSS calculates the size of elements and the space between them.
            The box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders,
            padding, and the actual content.
