  <h1> Using CSS</h1> 
<p>
    
    CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
    
        Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
        Internal - by using a "style" element in the head section
        External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file
    The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.
    Inline CSS
    An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.
    An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.
    The following example sets the text color of the h1 element to blue, and the text color of the p element to red:
    Example
</p>
<h1 style="color:blue;">A Blue Heading</h1>
<p style="color:red;">A red paragraph.</p> 

<p>
    Internal CSS<br>
    An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.
    The internal style is defined inside the head section of an HTML page, inside a "style" element.
    The following example defines a style for all p elements on the page:
    Example
</p>
<style>
p {
  color: red;
}   
</style>
<hr>
<p>External CSS<br>
    An external style sheet may be used to define the look and feel of a whole website.
    With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
    Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the head section.
    The following example references an external style sheet called "styles.css":
    Example
</p>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
<hr>
<p>
    The external style sheet can be written in any text editor. The file must not contain any HTML code, and must be saved with a .css extension.
    
    Here is what the "styles.css" file looks like:
    <pre>
    "styles.css":
    body {
      background-color: powderblue;
    }
    h1 {
      color: blue;
    }
    p {
      color: red;
    }
</pre>
</p> 
<hr>
